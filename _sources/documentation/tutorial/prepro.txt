Creating More Complex Domains
=============================

Up to now we have been very fond of the unit square as domain, which
is an appropriate choice for initial versions of a PDE solver. The
strength of the finite element method, however, is its ease of
handling domains with complex shapes. This section shows some methods
that can be used to create different types of domains and meshes.

Domains of complex shape must normally be constructed in separate
preprocessor programs. Two relevant preprocessors are Triangle for 2D
domains and NETGEN for 3D domains.

Built-In Mesh Generation Tools
------------------------------

DOLFIN has a few tools for creating various types of meshes over
domains with simple shape:
``UnitInterval``,
``UnitSquare``,
``UnitCube``,
``Interval``,
``Rectangle``,
``Box``,
``UnitCircle``,
and
``UnitSphere``.

.. index:: UnitInterval


.. index:: UnitSphere


.. index:: UnitSquare


.. index:: Interval


.. index:: Rectangle


.. index:: Box


.. index:: UnitCircle


.. index:: UnitCube

Some of these names have been briefly met in previous sections.  The
hopefully self-explanatory code snippet below summarizes typical
constructions of meshes with the aid of these tools:

.. code-block:: python

        # 1D domains
        mesh = UnitInterval(20)     # 20 cells, 21 vertices
        mesh = Interval(20, -1, 1)  # domain [-1,1]

        # 2D domains (6x10 divisions, 120 cells, 77 vertices)
        mesh = UnitSquare(6, 10)  # 'right' diagonal is default
        # The diagonals can be right, left or crossed
        mesh = UnitSquare(6, 10, 'left')
        mesh = UnitSquare(6, 10, 'crossed')

        # Domain [0,3]x[0,2] with 6x10 divisions and left diagonals
        mesh = Rectangle(0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 10, 'left')

        # 6x10x5 boxes in the unit cube, each box gets 6 tetrahedra:
        mesh = UnitCube(6, 10, 5)

        # Domain [-1,1]x[-1,0]x[-1,2] with 6x10x5 divisions
        mesh = Box(-1, -1, -1, 1, 0, 2, 6, 10, 5)

        # 10 divisions in radial directions
        mesh = UnitCircle(10)
        mesh = UnitSphere(10)

Transforming Mesh Coordinates
-----------------------------

.. index:: mesh transformations


.. index:: coordinate stretching


.. index:: coordinate transformations


A mesh that is denser toward a boundary is often desired to increase
accuracy in that region. Given a mesh with uniformly spaced
coordinates :math:`x_0,\ldots,x_{M-1}` in :math:`[a,b]`, the
coordinate transformation :math:`\xi = (x-a)/(b-a)` maps :math:`x`
onto :math:`\xi\in [0,1]`. A new mapping :math:`\eta = \xi^s`, for
some :math:`s>1`, stretches the mesh toward :math:`\xi=0`
(:math:`x=a`), while :math:`\eta = \xi^{1/s}` makes a stretching
toward :math:`\xi=1` (:math:`x=b`).  Mapping the :math:`\eta\in[0,1]`
coordinates back to :math:`[a,b]` gives new, stretched :math:`x`
coordinates,

.. math::

        \bar x = a + (b-a)\left({x-a\over b-a}\right)^s


toward :math:`x=a`, or

.. math::

        \bar x = a + (b-a)\left({x-a\over b-a}\right)^{1/s}


toward :math:`x=b`

One way of creating more complex geometries is to transform the vertex
coordinates in a rectangular mesh according to some formula.  Say we
want to create a part of a hollow cylinder of :math:`\Theta` degrees,
with inner radius :math:`a` and outer radius :math:`b`. A standard
mapping from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates can be used to
generate the hollow cylinder. Given a rectangle in :math:`(\bar x,
\bar y)` space such that :math:`a\leq \bar x\leq b` and :math:`0\leq
\bar y\leq 1`, the mapping

.. math::

        \hat x = \bar x\cos (\Theta \bar y),\quad \hat y = \bar x\sin (\Theta \bar y),


takes a point in the rectangular :math:`(\bar x,\bar y)` geometry and
maps it to a point :math:`(\hat x, \hat y)` in a hollow cylinder.

The corresponding Python code for first stretching the mesh and then
mapping it onto a hollow cylinder looks as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        Theta = pi/2
        a, b = 1, 5.0
        nr = 10  # divisions in r direction
        nt = 20  # divisions in theta direction
        mesh = Rectangle(a, 0, b, 1, nr, nt, 'crossed')

        # First make a denser mesh towards r=a
        x = mesh.coordinates()[:,0]
        y = mesh.coordinates()[:,1]
        s = 1.3

        def denser(x, y):
            return [a + (b-a)*((x-a)/(b-a))**s, y]

        x_bar, y_bar = denser(x, y)
        xy_bar_coor = numpy.array([x_bar, y_bar]).transpose()
        mesh.coordinates()[:] = xy_bar_coor
        plot(mesh, title='stretched mesh')

        def cylinder(r, s):
            return [r*numpy.cos(Theta*s), r*numpy.sin(Theta*s)]

        x_hat, y_hat = cylinder(x_bar, y_bar)
        xy_hat_coor = numpy.array([x_hat, y_hat]).transpose()
        mesh.coordinates()[:] = xy_hat_coor
        plot(mesh, title='hollow cylinder')
        interactive()

The result of calling ``denser`` and ``cylinder`` above is a list of
two vectors, with the :math:`x` and :math:`y` coordinates,
respectively.  Turning this list into a ``numpy`` array object results
in a :math:`2\times M` array, :math:`M` being the number of vertices
in the mesh. However, ``mesh.coordinates()`` is by a convention an
:math:`M\times 2` array so we need to take the transpose. The
resulting mesh is displayed in Figure
:ref:`tut:mesh:transform:cyl:fig1`.

Setting boundary conditions in meshes created from mappings like the
one illustrated above is most conveniently done by using a mesh
function to mark parts of the boundary. The marking is easiest to
perform before the mesh is mapped since one can then conceptually work
with the sides in a pure rectangle.
