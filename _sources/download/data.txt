This page provides a random collection of data (mostly meshes at this
point) for use with FEniCS. Feel free to download and use the data for
whatever purpose.

If you have some interesting geometry that you think would be
worthwhile to share with the rest of the FEniCS community, please
email your mesh along with a short description and a thumbnail image
(width 300px) to `Anders Logg <http://home.simula.no/~logg/>`__.
